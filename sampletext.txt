Once upon a time there lived a young man named Binglo Slabinostryj. He worked as a sailor off the western coast of the Black Sea. He was an energetic fellow, always ready to help people in need and never one to back down from a challenge. Heck, he would travel hundreds of miles just to give someone a helping hand. However, all that would change in one lone night.
On a Thursday afternoon, Binglo was simply scrubbing barnacles off the pier his ship was docked at. Right as he finished cleaning the bottom of the wood planks, he was approached by an ominous tall figure. The round hood they wore on their head was so big that only a tiny part of their chin was visible. After staring at each other for a bit, the mysterious character presented Binglo with a small wooden chest. They then asked: 
“Dear sailor, could you please deliver this to my friend? It’s supposed to be for his birthday, but today is way too busy of a day for me to give it to him myself. He lives in a hut near a lake in northern Moldova, if you travel along the river Dniester, you should be able to find it.”
Binglo, without hesitation, decided to help the cloaked individual and set sail nigh immediately. His high spirits and natural inclination towards helping others drove him to find the package’s recipient as soon as possible. He was so focused on delivering the present, in fact, that he forgot to double-check his map to see if Moldova had any lakes to begin with. While his determination was at an ever-so-high level, the same couldn’t have been said about Binglo’s food supplies. His repository of local seafood was diminishing much faster than he had hoped.
